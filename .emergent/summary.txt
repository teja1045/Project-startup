<analysis>**original_problem_statement:**
The user wants to build a full-stack web application to offer development, deployment, and QA services.
**PRODUCT REQUIREMENTS:**
- A modern, clean, and catchy UI.
- A feature to request quotes and book consultations.
- A secure admin dashboard with password protection to view and manage requests.
- The UI should have a modern glassmorphism (glass tiles) theme.
- A native mobile application (iOS and Android) with the same functionality and admin access.
- The branding should be NSSolutions with the custom domain .
- The Made with Emergent watermark must be removed.
- The admin section should be hidden from the public UI, and the admin should have a secure way to set and change their own password, with no default passwords visible.
- A custom logo provided by the user should be integrated into the website.

**User's preferred language**: English

**what currently exists?**
- A full-stack web application (React + FastAPI + MongoDB) branded as NSSolutions.
- The application features a glassmorphism UI, service display, a quote request form, and a consultation booking form.
- A secure admin dashboard exists at the  route, using JWT for authentication. From here, the admin can view/manage quotes and consultations, and also change their password.
- A file structure for a React Native mobile application has been created in the  directory, but it is not functional.
- The application's environment files have been configured for the custom domain .
- The user's custom logo has been successfully added to the web application's header.

**Last working item**:
- **Last item agent was working:** Integrating the user's custom logo into the web application. The agent downloaded the logo, placed it in , and updated the  component to display it in the navigation header.
- **Status:** USER VERIFICATION PENDING
- **Agent Testing Done:** Y
- **Which testing method agent to use?** screenshot tool
- **User Testing Done:** N

**All Pending/In progress Issue list**:
There are no outstanding bugs or issues from the previous session.

**In progress Task List**:
- **Task 1: Complete Mobile App Development (P0)**
  - **Where to resume:** The entire mobile app codebase in  needs to be implemented. The current state is just a file scaffold. The work involves implementing UI screens, integrating with the backend API (using the configuration in ), managing state, and ensuring full feature parity with the web application, including admin login and dashboard functionality.
  - **What will be achieved with this?** A fully functional native mobile app for both iOS and Android that allows users to request services and admins to manage the platform on the go.
  - **Status:** NOT STARTED
  - **Should Test frontend/backend/both after fix?** both
  - **Blocked on something:** None.

**Upcoming and Future Tasks**
- **Upcoming Tasks:**
  - **Integrate Logo into Mobile App (P1):** The logo exists at  but needs to be displayed within the mobile app's UI, likely in the header of  and other relevant screens.
  - **Implement Email Notifications (P1):** The user needs to be notified when a new quote or consultation is submitted. The agent should re-propose integrating an email service like Resend or SendGrid to send automatic email alerts to the admin. This will require backend implementation to trigger emails upon form submission.

**Code Architecture**


**Key Technical Concepts**
- **Frontend (Web):** React, React Router, TailwindCSS, Axios
- **Backend:** FastAPI, Python, Motor (async MongoDB driver), JWT
- **Database:** MongoDB
- **UI/UX:** Glassmorphism
- **Mobile:** React Native (scaffolded)

**key DB schema**
- **quotes:** 
- **consultations:** 
- **admin:** (Implicit) Credentials stored as  and  in .

**changes in tech stack**
- None.

**All files of reference**
- **/app/backend/server.py**: The core FastAPI application with all API endpoints for authentication, quotes, and consultations.
- **/app/frontend/src/App.js**: The main React component containing the application's routes and layout structure, including the newly added logo.
- **/app/frontend/src/pages/AdminDashboard.js**: The protected admin area for managing requests.
- **/app/scripts/setup_admin.py**: A crucial script for the next agent to set the initial admin password.
- **/app/mobile/App.js**: The entry point for the React Native mobile app, which is the focus of the next major task.
- **.env files:** , ,  all configured for the  domain.

**Areas that need refactoring**:
- The mobile application in  is currently just a non-functional skeleton. It requires a full implementation to be usable.

**key api endpoints**
- : Admin login.
- : Securely change the admin password.
- : Fetches all quote requests (protected).
- : Submits a new quote request.
- : Fetches all consultation requests (protected).
- : Submits a new consultation request.

**Critical Info for New Agent**
- **Admin Setup is Required:** To access the admin dashboard, you **must** first set the admin password by running the setup script. The app will not be fully testable without this step.
- **Mobile App is Not Functional:** The user has requested a mobile app, and while the file structure exists in , it is just a placeholder. The top priority is to build out this mobile application to match the functionality of the web app.
- **Custom Domain:** The entire application is configured to run on . The user has been instructed on how to set up their DNS records. All API calls and environment variables are already pointing to this domain.

**What agent forgot to execute**
- The agent did not implement the actual functionality of the mobile app after creating the file structure.
- The agent did not integrate the provided logo into the mobile app's UI, although the file was saved for it.
- The discussion about email notifications was dropped and should be revisited with the user to complete the feature.</analysis>
